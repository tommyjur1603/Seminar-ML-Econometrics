# Introduction

\pagenumbering{arabic}

One of the most important tasks in economics, medicine, statistics, and many other disciplines is estimating the causal effect of a treatment or intervention. Assuming that a treatment's impact is largely consistent across people and observations, a large portion of the literature has historically concentrated on estimating average treatment effects (ATEs). However, on many different scenarios, the effects of some sort of treatment are intrinsically heterogeneous, which means that they differ greatly among various groups or subpopulations. For instance, a novel medical intervention might be effective for younger patients but ineffective for elderly patients. Similarly, an educational program may have little effect on high achievers but improve results for students with inadequate prior preparation. 

\qquad The development of adaptable techniques that can reveal individual differences in treatment response has been spurred by the growing interest in these so-called \textbf{heterogeneous treatment effects}. However, there are a number of difficulties in precisely estimating them. In high-dimensional settings or when the form of heterogeneity is complex, traditional statistical techniques like regression with interaction terms or subgroup analysis can lose their reliability. Moreover, a lot of machine learning techniques are very good at forecasting results, but they are not made for drawing conclusions about causality, and they usually don't have reliable instruments for measuring uncertainty.

\qquad In response to this
methodological gap, @wager2018
propose the
\textbf{causal forest}, an
adaptation of Breiman’s random
forest algorithm
[@breiman2001] tailored for
the estimation of \textbf{conditional
average treatment effects} (or
CATEs). Their approach not
only offers the flexibility of
nonparametric machine learning
but also provides a
theoretical framework for
statistical inference,
including confidence intervals
for individual treatment
effects. This is made possible
through key innovations such
as the use of honest trees,
which separate the data used
for tree construction from the
data used for estimation, and
a variance estimation
technique based on the
infinitesimal jackknife for
random forests developed by
@wager2013.

\qquad The causal forest method
thus represents a significant
advancement in the field of
causal inference. It bridges
the gap between machine
learning’s ability to capture
complex relationships and the
statistical rigor needed for
credible statistical
inference.

\qquad The remainder of this
term paper will provide a
detailed overview of Wager and
Athey’s methodology, the
theoretical guarantees
supporting causal forests,
empirical performance as
demonstrated in an empirical
example, and a discussion of
the method’s limitations and
potential extensions.
